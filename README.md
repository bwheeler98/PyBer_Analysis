# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analzye and compare the attributes of PyBer for each city type (urban, suburban, and rural).  We were able to take raw data and break it up into multiple series and dataframes in order to better analyze the total drivers, total fares, and total ride count for each city type.  We were also able to calculate the average fare per ride, average fare per driver, and the total fare by city type.  With this data we can compare how impactful PyBer is in each city type.

## Results

After running our code we can see that PyBer is most prevelant in urban cities.  Urban cities have the most rides and drivers.  Because of this high supply of drivers and high demand for rides, urban cities have a lower average fare than rural and suburban rides.  The high supply of rides leads to urban cities having the highest total fare revenue.  Rural cities have by far the lowest amount of drivers, which is why their average fare per ride is the highest out of all 3 city types.

## Summary

Based on the data we gathered and calculated, I would advise V. Isualize to increase the advertising/marketing in rural cities in order to increase the amount of drivers.  The increase in the amount of available drivers would lead to an increase in demand for rides.  With an increase in drivers and ride demand the average fare per ride would decrease, which would further the increase in usage for PyBer in those areas and increase the overall revenue of the company.  Another recomendation would be to slightly increase the fare price for rides in urban areas, for the demand for rides is already very high, so there would be extra revenue gained by a slight increase in fare price.  The increase would have to be slight enough to where the demand for rides does not drop off.  Another idea would be to market heavier in suburban areas so that there is a higher demand for rides, which would increase the amount of drivers thus leading to more total rides and an increase in revenue.
